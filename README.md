# Neural Network in C++ (no libraries)

This project implements a neural network with two hidden layers in pure C++, without using any external machine learning libraries. The architecture and learning algorithm are based on the mathematical concepts presented in 3Blue1Brown's video on Neural Networks.

Overview

The goal of this project is to understand and implement the core mechanics of a feedforward neural network and backpropagation algorithm from scratch. The implementation includes:

Manual matrix operations
Forward propagation
Backpropagation for weight and bias updates
Basic training loop
Configurable architecture (input, hidden, and output sizes)

Features

Written entirely in standard C++
Fully manual implementation of backpropagation
Designed for learning and experimentation
